## What is envied?

Envied is a fork of [Devine](https://github.com/devine-dl/devine/). The name 'envied' is an anagram of Devine, and as such, pays homage to the original author rlaphoenix. 
Is is based on v 1.4.8 of unshackle. It is a powerful archival tool for downloading movies, TV shows, and music from streaming services. Built with a focus on modularity and extensibility, it provides a robust framework for content acquisition with support for DRM-protected content.

No commands have been changed 'uv run unshackle' still works as usual. 

The major difference is that envied comes complete and needs little configuration.
CDM and services are taken care of.
The prime reason for the existence of envied is a --select-titles function.

If you already use unshackle you'll probably just want to replace envied/unshackle/unshackle.yaml
with your own. But the exisiting yaml is close to working - just needs a few directory locations.
## Select Titles Feature

## Divergence from Envied's Parent
- **select-titles option**  avoid the uncertainty of -w S26E03 gobbledegook to get your video
- **Singleton Design Pattern** Good coding practice: where possible, a single instance of a Class is created and re-used. Saving time and resources.
- **Multitron Design Pattern** For those times when a Singleton will not do. Re-use Classes with care for the calling parameters. 
- **Clear Branding**  Clear presentation of the program name!
- **No Free Ride for Spammers**  Envied will not implement any methods used to connect to Decrypt Labs

## Quick Start

### Installation

This installs the latest version directly from the GitHub repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/vinefeeder/envied.git
cd unshackle
uv sync
uv run unshackle --help
```

### Install unshackle as a global (per-user) tool

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/vinefeeder/envied.git
# Then run:
uvx unshackle --help   # or just `unshackle` once PATH updated
```

> [!NOTE]
> After installation, you may need to add the installation path to your PATH environment variable if prompted.

> **Recommended:** Use `uv run unshackle` instead of direct command execution to ensure proper virtual environment activation.


### Basic Usage

```shell
# Check available commands
uv run unshackle --help

# Configure your settings
git clone https://github.com/vinefeeder/envied.git
cd unshackle
uv sync
uv run unshackle --help

# Download content (requires configured services)
uv run unshackle dl SERVICE_NAME CONTENT_ID
